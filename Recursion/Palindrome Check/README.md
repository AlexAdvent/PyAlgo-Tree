# Palindrome Check  


## Aim

The aim is to create a python code to check if a given string is palindrome or not by recursion

## Short description of project

The project takes in input the string to be checked, and if it comparisons are case sensitive, 
and then checks the string by comparing the first and last member of string and checking on a shorter version of string recursively

## Required libraries

None

## Compilation Steps
Run the script, after that :
  
 1. User is prompted to enter a string which will be checked
 2. User is asked if comparisons are to be case sensitive, enter 0 for False, 1 for True
 3. The program tells if the string is a palindrome or not
