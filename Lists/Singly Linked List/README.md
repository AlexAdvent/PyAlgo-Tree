# Singly Linked List

## Aim

To implement Singly Linked List data structure in Python.


## Purpose

The purpose is to create an alternative data structure to array.


## Short description of package/script

- Linked List is a collection of nodes that are connected through their references.
- In Singly Linked List every node points the next node. Last node points to None.
- Linked List provides insertion and deletion in O(1) time.
- It is an alternative data structure to array.


## Workflow of the Project

- This script contains a class named SinglyLinkedList. It manages the linked list.

* The Singly Linked List class contains,
    - Class,
        - _Node: Used to store data.
    - Methods,
        - append(), 
        - clear(), 
        - extend(), 
        - index(), 
        - insert(), 
        - pop(), 
        - remove(), 
        - reverse(). 

+ On the outer appearance it exactly act as Python's Built-in List.


## Setup instructions

Import the script by,

```
from singly_linked_list import *
```
OR
```
import singly_linked_list
```

After import create an instance of Singly Linked List.
```
variable = SinglyLinkedList()
```
OR
```
variable = singly_linked_list.SinglyLinkedList()
```

And start the work on it, That's all ✌️


## Sample Test Cases

To run test cases simply run this script.
