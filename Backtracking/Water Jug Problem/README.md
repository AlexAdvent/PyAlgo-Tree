# Water Jug Problem

## Aim

The aim is to solve Water Jug Problem using BFS or DFS as per user's choice.


## Purpose

Given Problem: You are given a 'm' liter jug and a 'n' liter jug where '0<m<n'. Both the jugs are initially empty. The jugs don't have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. You have to use the jugs to measure 'd' liters of water where 'd<n'. Determine the minimum no of operations to be performed to obtain 'd' liters of water in one of jug. The **purpose** is to come up with a solution for this problem.


## Short description of package/script

- The problem is solved by BFS/DFS.
- Backtracking is used.
- Complete steps are described; each and every state mentioned.


## Workflow of the Project

The side-by-side comments added in the code provide a detailed explaination for the workflow.


## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:
1. The volume for first jug.
2. The volume of secong jug.
3. The desired amount of water.
4. Choose the search technique.
That's it! All the steps to the goal state (if found) will be listed.
