# Caesar_Cipher

## Aim

The aim is to build a Caesar Cipher Algorithm


## Purpose

To create a Encryption/Decryption program which uses Caesar_Cipher Technique


## Short description of package/script

- The problem is solved using Caesar Substitution algorithm
- We use Python libraries Random while encryption


## Workflow of the Project

Description of functions used in the code and their purpose:

decrypt --> Method for decrypting the inputted encrypted code

encrypt --> Method to encrypt the input string



After the desired choice is entered by the user, the  functions gain control and process accordingly


## Compilation Steps

After the script is run, enter:

1. Choose what you want to do encrypt or decrypt
2. Functions encrypt or decrypt accordingly.
