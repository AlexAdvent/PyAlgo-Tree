The Caesar Cipher was an early substitution cipher. 
In the Caesar Cipher, each character is shifted three places up. Therefore, A becomes D and B becomes E, etcâ€¦
A Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. 
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
